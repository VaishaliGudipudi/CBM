# CBM OF NAVAL PROPULSION PLANT DATASET 

NAME OF THE DATASET: CBM of naval propulsion plant dataset

SOURCE: UCI Machine Learning Repository

ABOUT THE DATASET: The dataset has been generated from a sophisticated simulator of a gas turbine mounted on a Frigate or in simpler terms a naval vessel. It is important to check the condition of the navel vessel their behaviour and interaction of the main components of ship propulsion systems as they cannot be easily modelled with a prior physical knowledge considering the large number of variables influencing them. The data driven models, advance statistical techniques help to build models on the data collected by modern on-board automatic systems. Data driven models are useful when it comes to continuously monitoring the propulsion equipment to avoid preventive or corrective maintenance and take decisions based on the actual condition of the propulsion plant.

---> Completed this project as a part of my Data Science and Machine Learning internship project with the United Network of Professionals(UNP).

KEY HIGHLIGHTS:

1.Performed data importing, data cleaning and data transformation to understand the dataset.

2.Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset in detail.

3.Built various Regression models namely Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression, Bagging Regresssion, KNN Regression

Compared the results to recommend the best regression model suitable for naval propulsion condition based management
